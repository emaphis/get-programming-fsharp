// Now youâ€™re going to create a lookup for all the root folders on your hard disk and the
// times that they were created:
// 1 Open a blank script.
// 2 Get a list of all directories within the C:\ drive on your computer (you can use
//   System.IO.Directory.EnumerateDirectories). The result will be a sequence of strings.
// 3 Convert each string into a full DirectoryInfo object. Use Seq.map to perform the
//   conversion.
// 4 Convert each DirectoryInfo into a tuple of the Name of the folder and its Creation-
//   TimeUtc, again using Seq.map.
// 5 Convert the sequence into a Map of Map.ofSeq.
// 6 Convert the values of the Map into their age in days by using Map.map. You can sub-
//   tract the creation time from the current time to achieve this.

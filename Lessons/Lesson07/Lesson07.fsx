// Now you try
// Letâ€™s quickly look at unit with a few practical examples:

// 1 Create an instance of unit by using standard let binding syntax; the right-hand 
//   side of the equals sign needs to be ().
// 2 Call the describeAge function and assign the result of the function call to a separate 
//   value.
// 3 Check whether the two values are equal to one another. What is the result?

let u = ()
let y = describeAge 20

// unit isn't really an object
//u.Equals(y)
//u.GetHashCode()
//u.GetType()
//u.ToString()

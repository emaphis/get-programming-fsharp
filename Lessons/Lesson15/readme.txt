Lesson 15  Working with collections  - pg 171

The three standard F# collections are Seq, List, Array

Pipelines make it convenient to compost functions over
collections.

Seq, List Array are implemented in terms of the same interface
so functions written to that interface can polymorphically operate
over those structures

F# can use .Net mutable lists
